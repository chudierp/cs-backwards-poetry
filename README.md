<h1>Backwards Poetry</h1><br>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this project we will write a Python program to print out poetry backwards, randomly, and any way you can rearrange! By reading a poem in news ways we can discover new meanings or invite new interpretations.

<h3>Poem</h3>

<p>If you are a dreamer, come in,
If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar,
A hope-er, a pray-er, a magic bean buyer…
If you’re a pretender, come sit by my fire
For we have some flax-golden tales to spin.
Come in!
Come in!</p>
